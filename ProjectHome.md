Any finace (?) company that trades in financial instruments such as equities and bonds needs to capture/record those transactions and often provide settlement funtionality off the back of them.

This project, if it progresses, will provide said functionality.

Note, its inception is designed as a self-teach programming effort so a working solutionmay never see the light of day.
