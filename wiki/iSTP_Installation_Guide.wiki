#How to install iSTP

= Introduction =

As this is far from a production solution we use nothing more than XAMPP as a quick and easy way of getting Apache, PHP and MySQL up and running - this is an exercise in learning to program applications, not how to get the base software working on Vista!

Curretnly using [http://www.apachefriends.org/download.php?xampp-win32-1.6.7-installer.exe XAMPP 1.6.7] which sees us using 
  * Apache HTTPD 2.2.9
  * MySQL 5.0.51b
  * PHP 5.2.6

On top of that we use
  * [http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/29263/ruby186-26.exe Ruby 1.8.6-26 Final Release]

= Details =

Fuller installation details to follow but for now

  * Install XAMPP - we ue c:\XAMPP to get over Vista related security issues
  * Install Ruby - we install to c:\XAMPP\ruby to keep all the application files together
  * Install Rails by opening a command prompt and issuing the following command and acknowledge Yes to install any dependencies
    * gem install rails

That's it... for now.  This project is too early in its life to be packaged up as a Gem so when the first bit of code is ready it will be a .zip that you can just copy over by hand, along with the MySql database creation script.
